# cGANS_DT

The current repository contains code to generate data, run the experiments and recreate results 
for using generative models in order to define digital twins/mirrors of a simulated cantilever 
structure with uncertainties.

Data: contains the data used in order to recreate the experiments.

BeamSFEM: contains the code needed to run the stochastic finite element simulations.

saved_models: contains the pre-trained models whose results are reported in the paper.

cGAN.py: Module containing the cGAN code.

cGAN_extrapol.py: Module containing the cGAN code required to run extrapolation.

cGAN_extrapolation_testing_results.py:
